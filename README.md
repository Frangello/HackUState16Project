# HackUState16Project
This project used Amadeus API, found at https://sandbox.amadeus.com/api-catalog , to look for flight fares every X seconds. 
In conjunction, an Arduino Uno was used to light up a LED if a low fare was found. 

This project was built during a hackathon, where there is no time for documentantion or decent coding standards. It was build mainly for fun. If you would like more help setting it up, contact me. 

A schematics for the arduino can be found in this repo as schematics.png
